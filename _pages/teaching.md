description: "My teaching objective is to train students to develop critical thinking and, in the process, to appreciate and build 'economic thinking' skills. Beyond my experience as a teaching assistant across various economics courses, I also taught 'Economic Concepts' for two years. This course, tailored for non-business majors, introduces students to key insights from economic theory and econometrics."
